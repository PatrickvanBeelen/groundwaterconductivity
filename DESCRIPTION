Description: It calculates the electric conductivity of water at 25Â°C from the ionic composition of the water. 
    The comparison of the calculated and the measured electric conductivity is useful for quality control of groundwater and surface water monitoring programs. 
    The user must make an input file with the proper names and dimensions of the measured cations and anions. 
    The script reads the input file and produces an output file with the calculated conductivity using the formulas described by a Dutch report by 
    Stuyfzand, P. (1987). Een zeer nauwkeurige berekening van het elektrischgeleidingsvermogen, ter controle en aanvulling van wateranalyses: 2e versie. Rijswijk, KIWA. 
    This report selects an optimal calculation method for each individual set of measured ions. 
    It allows an accurate calculation of the conductivity for a wide range of different groundwater types. 
    The method was compared with a well-known publication of 
    McCleskey, R. B., et al. (2012). "A new method of calculating electrical conductivity with applications to natural waters." Geochimica et cosmochimica acta 77: 369-382.
    The Dutch report gave accurate results over a much wider range of different groundwater types.
